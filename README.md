The purpose of this assignment was to write a combination of algorithms that would split up a .txt file into Ngrams of a length determined by a command line argument. The second algorithm then sorts the Ngrams using a bubble sort method. The final algorithm counts the frequency of each Ngram and prints the count of each Ngram.
